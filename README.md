# Description
the game was made fully on c++ using OOP
we used the CMUgraphicsLibrary to display the GUI

The game consisted of two main menus

### Desgin Menu

you are the artist now you can add the ladders/snakes any where you want, not only that you can also save 
the style of board you want and retreive it at any time.

### Game mode

now comes the fun part where you play with your friend and experience the map you just built yourself
you can roll the dice to play or use the fixed dice and choose a number of your choice if you want to cheat :)


##Modularity

we focused on modularity and easy to refactor code that's why you can easily 
change the size or the player count with just one line of code

in this example the height/width was set to 12 and the game now has 144 cells instead of a 100 awesome!!
